Because of the scheduling mixup, the welcome message is coming after week one. My apologies! We'll get into the swing of things better in week 2.

**Important**: Class will be held on Wednesday nights, not Thursday nights as reported by Ellen. Again, apologies for the mix-up.

Don't forget to email me a link to some interesting example of data journalism and a few sentences about why you like it.

Check out the [syllabus](https://digitalframeworks.github.io/syllabus/). The syllabus can and will change as the quarter goes on, but .

You'll need to sign up for some services before week 2:

* [Slack](https://nwudigitalframeworks.slack.com/signup)
* [Google](https://accounts.google.com/signup)

There's a few more services you'll need to sign up for throughout the course. You don't _have_ to sign up for them for this week, but might as well, right?

* [Github](https://github.com/join)
* [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/login)
* [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/)

Feel free to ask questions in the comments below or directly via Slack.
