Because of the scheduling mixup, the welcome message is coming after week one. My apologies! We'll get into the swing of things better in week 2.

**Important**: Class will be held on Wednesday nights, not Thursday nights as reported by Ellen. Again, apologies for the mix-up.

Make sure you check out the [syllabus](https://digitalframeworks.github.io/syllabus/). The syllabus can and will change as the quarter goes on, but we'll definitely be covering all the topics from the syllabus in roughly the order that's currently there.

Your homework for Wednesday is to email me a link to some interesting example of data journalism and a few sentences about why you think it's interesting. Don't fear, the homework will get harder.

My own submission for the week is John Oliver's [Debt Buyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxUAntt1z2c) segment on Last Week Tonight. Oliver's pieces are always impeccably sourced and researched, even when the jokes are a little stupid. This one goes further by actually going through the process of setting up a debt-buying company and purchasing a debt portfolio. It's a brilliant combination of old school investigative tricks, modern data research, and pure cable tv theater.

You'll need to sign up for some services before week 2:

* [Slack](https://nwudigitalframeworks.slack.com/signup) -- sign up with your u.northwestern.edu address.
* [Google](https://accounts.google.com/signup) -- it's likely you already have a Google account, but it can't hurt to be explicit.

There's a few more services you'll need to sign up for throughout the course. You don't _have_ to sign up for them for this week, but might as well, right?

* [Github](https://github.com/join)
* [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/login)
* [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/)
* [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/signup)

Feel free to ask questions in the comments below or directly via Slack.
